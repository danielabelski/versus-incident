## How Versus Creates Incidents

Incidents reach Versus two ways, and both are handled by the same notification, templating, and on-call logic:

- **AI SRE Agent (auto-detect)** — point the agent at your logs and it learns your normal patterns, then automatically raises an incident when a brand-new error or anomaly appears. No alert rules to maintain.
- **Webhook alerts (you define)** — any tool that can POST a webhook (Alertmanager, Grafana, Sentry, CloudWatch SNS, FluentBit, or your own scripts) sends incidents straight to Versus, formatted with your own templates.

Whichever source raises it, an incident is templated, fanned out to every channel you enable, and escalated to on-call if it isn't acknowledged in time.

## Features

- 🤖 **AI SRE Agent**: An AI agent that reads your logs, learns what normal looks like, and automatically opens an incident only when something new and unexpected appears.
- 🌐 **Webhook Alerts**: Receive incidents from any tool that can POST a webhook — Alertmanager, Grafana, Sentry, CloudWatch SNS, FluentBit, and more.
- 🚨 **Multi-channel Notifications**: Fan out every incident to Slack, Microsoft Teams, Telegram, Viber, Email, and Lark (more channels coming!)
- 📝 **Custom Templates**: Define your own alert messages using Go templates
- 🔧 **Easy Configuration**: YAML-based configuration with environment variables support
- 📡 **REST API**: Simple HTTP interface to receive alerts
- 📞 **On-Call**: On-Call integrations (PagerDuty, Opsgenie, incident.io, ServiceNow)

## Get Started

### Auto-detect incidents with the AI SRE Agent

Let the agent learn your logs and surface what's new. The AI SRE Agent has three modes:

- **`training`** — just watch and learn. No alerts.
- **`shadow`** — watch and learn, plus write a "would have alerted"
  log entry every time a line would have triggered an alert. Still
  no real alerts. Good for checking the agent's judgement before
  going live.
- **`detect`** — actually create incidents for lines the agent has
  never seen before. An AI SRE triages each one and writes the
  summary, severity, and suggested next steps before the incident
  is sent through every configured channel.

Start it in **training mode** — it only watches and learns, and never sends an alert until you're ready.

```bash
# Redis is used to remember where the agent left off in each log source.
docker run -d --name versus-redis -p 6379:6379 redis:7

docker run -p 3000:3000 \
  -e GATEWAY_SECRET=change-me \
  -e AGENT_ENABLE=true \
  -e AGENT_MODE=training \
  -e REDIS_HOST=host.docker.internal \
  -e REDIS_PORT=6379 \
  -v $(pwd)/config:/app/config \
  -v $(pwd)/data:/app/data \
  ghcr.io/versuscontrol/versus-incident
```

The agent needs a `config.yaml` and an `agent_sources.yaml` that point it at your logs. Once it's running, review the patterns it learns on the **admin dashboard** at <http://localhost:3000/>, then switch `AGENT_MODE` from `training` → `shadow` → `detect` when you trust it.

Full walkthrough (with ready-to-copy config and a sample log generator): [AI Agent — Getting Started](https://docs.versusincident.com/#/agent/getting-started).

### Forward alerts from your existing tools

Already have monitoring? Run Versus and POST your alerts to its webhook endpoint.

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 \
  -e GATEWAY_SECRET=change-me \
  -e SLACK_ENABLE=true \
  -e SLACK_TOKEN=your_token \
  -e SLACK_CHANNEL_ID=your_channel \
  ghcr.io/versuscontrol/versus-incident
```

Versus listens on port 3000 by default and exposes:

- `POST /api/incidents` — webhook endpoint for monitoring tools.
- `GET  /` — the embedded **admin dashboard**, open <http://localhost:3000/> in your browser. For the full UI walkthrough and the build/watch scripts, see [Admin Dashboard](https://docs.versusincident.com/#/configuration/admin-ui).

> **You can use both.** The AI agent and webhook alerts are not mutually exclusive — run them together and every incident, whether auto-detected or forwarded from your tools, flows through the same channels, templates, and on-call logic.

## AI Agent

The **AI SRE agent** is what makes Versus different: point it at your logs and it learns what *normal* looks like, then automatically opens an incident the moment a brand-new error or anomaly appears — no alert rules to maintain.

Configuration example with agent features:

```yaml
name: versus
host: 0.0.0.0
port: 3000

# ... existing alert configurations ...

# Shared secret required for ALL admin endpoints (`/api/admin/*` and
# `/api/agent/*`). API clients send it in `X-Gateway-Secret`; the dashboard
# exchanges it once for an opaque HttpOnly session cookie.
gateway_secret: ${GATEWAY_SECRET}

# Storage backend for the pattern catalog, shadow log, and incident
# history. Only `file` is implemented today; `redis` and `database`
# are config stubs.
storage:
  type: file              # file | redis | database (env: STORAGE_TYPE)
  file:
    max_incidents: 1000   # rolling cap on persisted incidents

agent:
  enable: false # Use this to enable or disable the agent for all sources
  mode: training # Valid values: "training", "shadow", or "detect"
  poll_interval: 30s

  # Sources are kept in a separate file so they can be managed independently
  # (e.g. swap fixtures, per-environment lists). Path is resolved relative to
  # this config file. Override via env: AGENT_SOURCES_PATH.
  sources_path: ./agent_sources.yaml

  catalog:
    persist_interval: 30s
    auto_promote_after: 100 # In detect mode, this many sightings = "known"

  redaction:
    enable: true
    redact_ips: false
    extra_patterns: # Optional: extra regex rules to scrub before clustering
      - "(?i)password=\\S+"
      - "Authorization:\\s*Bearer\\s+\\S+"

  miner:
    similarity_threshold: 0.4
    tree_depth: 4
    max_children: 100

  regex:
    # Optional: tag any signal whose message matches this pattern
    # if none of the named rules below hit. Leave empty to disable.
    default_pattern: "(?i)error|exception|fatal|panic"
    # Named rules are tried first, in order. The first match wins.
    rules:
      - name: oom
        pattern: "(?i)out of memory|OOMKilled|java\\.lang\\.OutOfMemoryError"
      - name: db-timeout
        pattern: "(?i)(connection|query) timeout|deadlock detected"
      - name: auth-failure
        pattern: "(?i)401 unauthorized|invalid credentials|permission denied"

redis: # Required for the agent to persist source cursors across restarts
  host: ${REDIS_HOST}
  port: ${REDIS_PORT}
  password: ${REDIS_PASSWORD}
  db: 0
```

**Explanation:**

The `agent` section includes:
1. `enable`: Turn the agent on or off (default: `false`). When disabled, nothing extra runs — no background processes, no extra files written.
2. `mode`: How the agent behaves after it has learned your log patterns:
   - `training`: observation only — the agent learns patterns and saves them, but sends no alerts.
   - `shadow`: same as training, but also logs a note every time it would have sent an alert. Good for reviewing before going live.
   - `detect`: the agent actively sends alerts for any pattern it has never seen before.
3. `poll_interval`: How often the agent checks your log sources for new entries.
4. `catalog`: Where the agent stores the list of known patterns and how often to write updates. `mode` selects the storage backend — only `file` is supported today, which writes to `data/patterns.json` (the filename and directory are fixed).

> **Admin secret.** All admin endpoints (`/api/admin/*` and
> `/api/agent/*`) are protected by the **root-level** `gateway_secret`
> (env `GATEWAY_SECRET`). Set it to any value you choose; clients send
> the same value in the `X-Gateway-Secret` header. The dashboard sends it
> only to `POST /api/auth/gateway-session`, then uses an HttpOnly,
> SameSite=Strict cookie with an eight-hour absolute lifetime. Reloads reuse
> the cookie; sign-out, expiry, cookie clearing, or secret rotation requires
> signing in again. When no secret is
> configured the admin endpoints are not registered and the agent
> refuses to start.
>
> Set the root-level `public_host` to the exact browser-visible HTTP(S) origin,
> for example `https://versus.example.com`. Versus validates and normalizes it
> at startup and uses it for external links, cookie `Secure`, and exact-origin
> checks behind TLS-terminating or Host-rewriting proxies. Forwarded
> protocol/host headers are not trusted implicitly. Leave it empty for a direct
> deployment, where the request's actual protocol and Host are used for browser
> security checks.

> **Storage.** The agent's catalog and the incident history shown in the
> UI are persisted via the **root-level** `storage:` block (default:
> `type: file`). The file backend writes to the fixed `./data` directory
> (`/app/data` in the container image).
5. `redaction`: Rules for automatically removing sensitive information (passwords, tokens, emails, etc.) from logs before the agent processes them.
6. `miner`: Controls how aggressively the agent groups similar log lines together. The defaults work well for most setups.
7. `regex`: Acts as a **pre-filter** for the agent. Only signals whose message matches at least one rule (a named entry under `rules` or `default_pattern`) are forwarded to the pattern miner and stored in the catalog. Anything that doesn't match is dropped before clustering, so boring noise (200-OK requests, debug lines, etc.) never bloats `patterns.json`.

   - Named `rules` are tried in order; the first match wins and tags the signal with that `name` (stored as `rule_name` on the pattern).
   - If no named rule hits, `default_pattern` is tried. Matches there are tagged with `name=default`.
   - **To learn from every line, set `default_pattern: ".*"`.** This is useful in early training when you don't yet know what's interesting.
   - **To filter aggressively, set `default_pattern: ""` (empty)** and rely on your named rules — anything that doesn't match an explicit rule is dropped.
8. `sources_path`: Path to a separate YAML file that lists the log sources the agent should read from. Keeping sources in their own file makes it easier to manage per-environment source lists or swap fixtures without touching the rest of the config. The path is resolved relative to the main config file. Override via the `AGENT_SOURCES_PATH` env var.

The sources file (default `./agent_sources.yaml`) has a single top-level `sources:` list. Each entry needs `name`, `type` (`file` or `elasticsearch`), `enable`, plus a matching `file:` or `elasticsearch:` block. Example:

```yaml
sources:
  - name: prod-app
    type: elasticsearch
    enable: true
    elasticsearch:
      addresses:
        - https://es.example.internal:9200
      username: ${ES_USERNAME}
      password: ${ES_PASSWORD}
      index: "logs-app-*"
      time_field: "@timestamp"
      query: 'log.level:(error OR warn)'
      message_field: message
      page_size: 500

  - name: sample-app
    type: file
    enable: true
    file:
      path: ./local/resource/sample-app.log
      format: text
      from_beginning: true
```

The `redis` section is required when `agent.enable` is `true`. Redis is used to remember where the agent left off in each log source, so it picks up from the right place after a restart.

For detailed information on integration, please refer to the document here: [Enable AI Agent](https://docs.versusincident.com/#/agent/agent-introduction).

## Webhook Alerts

Already using other monitoring tools? Versus also accepts incidents from anything that can POST JSON to `/api/incidents`, so you can route existing alerts through the same channels, templates, and on-call.

### Universal Alert Template Support

Our default template (Slack, Telegram) automatically handles alerts from multiple sources, including:
- Alertmanager (Prometheus)
- Grafana Alerts
- Sentry
- CloudWatch SNS
- FluentBit

#### Example JSON Payload Sent by Alertmanager

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:3000/api/incidents" \

## On-Call

Versus supports On-Call integrations with AWS Incident Manager and PagerDuty. Updated configuration example with on-call features:

```yaml
name: versus
host: 0.0.0.0
port: 3000
public_host: https://your-ack-host.example # Required for on-call ack

# ... existing alert configurations ...

oncall:
  ### Enable overriding using query parameters
  # /api/incidents?oncall_enable=false => Set to `true` or `false` to enable or disable on-call for a specific alert
  # /api/incidents?oncall_wait_minutes=0 => Set the number of minutes to wait for acknowledgment before triggering on-call. Set to `0` to trigger immediately
  initialized_only: true  # Initialize on-call feature but don't enable by default; use query param oncall_enable=true to enable for specific requests
  enable: false # Use this to enable or disable on-call for all alerts
  wait_minutes: 3 # If you set it to 0, it means there's no need to check for an acknowledgment, and the on-call will trigger immediately
  provider: aws_incident_manager # Valid values: "aws_incident_manager" or "pagerduty"

  aws_incident_manager: # Used when provider is "aws_incident_manager"
    response_plan_arn: ${AWS_INCIDENT_MANAGER_RESPONSE_PLAN_ARN}
    other_response_plan_arns: # Optional: Enable overriding the default response plan ARN using query parameters, eg /api/incidents?awsim_other_response_plan=prod
      prod: ${AWS_INCIDENT_MANAGER_OTHER_RESPONSE_PLAN_ARN_PROD}
      dev: ${AWS_INCIDENT_MANAGER_OTHER_RESPONSE_PLAN_ARN_DEV}
      staging: ${AWS_INCIDENT_MANAGER_OTHER_RESPONSE_PLAN_ARN_STAGING}

  pagerduty: # Used when provider is "pagerduty"
    routing_key: ${PAGERDUTY_ROUTING_KEY} # Integration/Routing key for Events API v2 (REQUIRED)
    other_routing_keys: # Optional: Enable overriding the default routing key using query parameters, eg /api/incidents?pagerduty_other_routing_key=infra
      infra: ${PAGERDUTY_OTHER_ROUTING_KEY_INFRA}
      app: ${PAGERDUTY_OTHER_ROUTING_KEY_APP}
      db: ${PAGERDUTY_OTHER_ROUTING_KEY_DB}

redis: # Required for on-call functionality
  insecure_skip_verify: true # dev only
  host: ${REDIS_HOST}
  port: ${REDIS_PORT}
  password: ${REDIS_PASSWORD}
  db: 0
```

**Explanation:**

The `oncall` section includes:
1. `enable`: A boolean to toggle on-call functionality for all incidents (default: `false`).
2. `initialized_only`: Initialize on-call feature but keep it disabled by default. When set to `true`, on-call is triggered only for requests that explicitly include `?oncall_enable=true` in the URL. This is useful for having on-call ready but not enabled for all alerts.
3. `wait_minutes`: Time in minutes to wait for an acknowledgment before escalating (default: `3`). Setting it to `0` triggers the on-call immediately.
4. `provider`: Specifies which on-call provider to use ("aws_incident_manager" or "pagerduty").
5. `aws_incident_manager`: Configuration for AWS Incident Manager when it's the selected provider, including `response_plan_arn` and `other_response_plan_arns`.
6. `pagerduty`: Configuration for PagerDuty when it's the selected provider, including routing keys.

The redis section is required when `oncall.enable` or `oncall.initialized_only` is true. It configures the Redis instance used for state management or queuing, with settings like host, port, password, and db.

For detailed information on integration, please refer to the document here: [On-Call setup with Versus](https://docs.versusincident.com/#/oncall/on-call-introduction).

#   2: mode=shadow,   review log lines `agent[shadow]: would alert ...`
#   3: mode=detect    (AI emission ships in a follow-up milestone)
